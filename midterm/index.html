            <h2>Climbing The Mountains</h2>
            <div class="Clearfix"><img id="f1-image" src="images/mountains.jpg" alt="images/sia">
                <p>Mountaineering, also called mountain climbing, is the sport of attaining, or attempting to attain, high points in mountainous regions, mainly for the pleasure of the climb. Although the term is often loosely applied to walking up low mountains that offer only moderate difficulties, it is more properly restricted to climbing in localities where the terrain and weather conditions present such hazards that a certain amount of previous experience will be found necessary. For the untrained, mountaineering is a dangerous pastime.</p>
                <p>Mountaineering differs from other outdoor sports in that nature alone provides the field of action—and just about all of the challenges—for the participant. Climbing mountains embodies the thrills produced by testing one’s courage, resourcefulness, cunning, strength, ability, and stamina to the utmost in a situation of inherent risk. Mountaineering, to a greater degree than other sports, is a group activity, with each member both supporting and supported by the group’s achievement at every stage. For most climbers, the pleasures of mountaineering lie not only in the “conquest” of a peak but also in the physical and spiritual satisfactions brought about through intense personal effort and contact with natural grandeur.</p>
                <p>Early attempts to ascend mountain peaks were inspired by motives other than sport: building altars, getting an overview of one’s own or a neighboring countryside, or making meteorological or geological observations. Before the modern era, history recorded few attempts to ascend mountain peaks for the mere sake of the accomplishment. During the 18th century, a growing number of natural philosophers—the scientists of their day—began making field trips into the Alps of Europe to make scientific observations. The area around Chamonix, France, became a special attraction to those investigators because of the great glaciers on the Mont Blanc chain.</p>

                <h3>Some facts about climbing</h3>
                <ul class="Facts">
                    <li>Mountaineering in a contemporary sporting sense was born when a young Genevese scientist, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, on a first visit to Chamonix in 1760,</li>
                    <li>the tallest peak in Europe) and determined that he would climb to the top of it or be responsible for its being climbed. He offered prize money for the first ascent of Mont Blanc, but it was not until 1786, more than 25 years later, that his money was claimed—by a Chamonix doctor, Michel-Gabriel Paccard, and his porter, Jacques Balmat.</li>
                    <li>A year later de Saussure himself climbed to the summit of Mont Blanc. After 1850, groups of British climbers with Swiss, Italian, or French guides scaled one after another of the high peaks of Switzerland. A landmark climb in the growth of the sport was the spectacular first ascent of the Matterhorn (14,692 feet [4,478 meters]) on July 14, 1865, by Edward Whymper. In the mid-19th century, the Swiss developed a coterie of guides whose leadership helped make mountaineering a distinguished sport as they led the way to peak after peak throughout central Europe.</li>
